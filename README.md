In today's advanced world, an event like Carrington occurs which leads to the destruction of technology and resources of Earth. To protect and shield our earth, we have developed PRECOGNITOR.  This software will alert you 2 hours before a Carrington event or solar storm. It will automatically help to shut down the grid power supply from satellites in a very short time. To spread awareness about this event, we have developed a game that will provide the right way or direction to handle the situation calmly. Our aim is to inform the world about the disaster in a friendlier manner, which helps the citizens not to panic.     FUTURE PLANS     Our future plan is to build software embedded with damphering device functionality, with high capacitors and low voltage supply.  If an event occurs, then we could provide life support machines to hospitals.   Every single thing on earth can be disconnected, but not a single patient will be disconnected from life support.     SOFTWARE FEATURES  PRECOGNITOR has a feature to detect the solar storm, Carrington event before 2 hours.  It has a feature to identify the regions where the event's effect will be vast and it will list the regions to prevent serious effects.  Awareness GAME will be there which consists of basic information about the events to handle situations calmly.
